Task: Internship Applications Automation
We want to automate the collection of internship candidates’ data from email into a structured CSV file.
Every time a candidate sends us an email for an internship, their information (name, email address, phone number, CV link/attachment, etc.) should be automatically extracted.
This data should then be saved/exported into a CSV file that will serve as our central sheet of all applicants.
The system should run automatically without manual copy-paste.
Ideally, it should be connected to our mailbox (Gmail/Outlook).
Deliverable:
A script or tool that automatically extracts and updates a CSV file with new candidates’ information whenever we receive an internship request email.
