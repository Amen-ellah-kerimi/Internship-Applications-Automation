- Secure storage of credentials and attachments
- Responsive Flask dashboard for viewing, searching, and managing candidates
- Settings page for IMAP and internship code mapping
- CSV export and duplicate detection
- Logging and error handling

## Setup & Usage
1. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
2. **Run setup script to generate .env and Fernet key:**
  ```bash
  python setup.py
  ```
  - Enter your IMAP email user and password/app token when prompted.
  - The script will generate a Fernet key and save all credentials in `.env`.
3. **Run the Flask app:**
  ```bash
  python -m src.webapp.app
  ```
4. **Access the dashboard:**
  - Open your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Configuration
- **.env**: Stores IMAP credentials and Fernet key.
- **Settings page**: Allows you to update IMAP server, folder, attachment folder, and internship code mapping (JSON).
- **Database**: Stored in `instance/database.db` (ignored by git).
- **Attachments**: Saved in `attachements/` (ignored by git).

## Security
- **Fernet Key**: Used for encrypting sensitive data (e.g., email password) in the database. Generated by `setup.py` and stored in `.env`.
- **IMAP Credentials**: Entered during setup and stored securely in `.env`.

## Documentation
- See `docs/OVERVIEW.md` for a detailed project overview and workflow.
- See `docs/start.md` for dashboard setup instructions.
- See `docs/task.md` for project checklist and structure.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for coding standards and contribution guidelines.

## Example .env
```
EMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=yourpassword
FERNET_KEY=your-generated-fernet-key
```

## Example Workflow
1. Scrape new candidates from email inbox.
2. View and manage candidates in the dashboard.
3. Download or read attachments (CVs, portfolios).
4. Update settings as needed.

## How to Get Gmail IMAP Credentials

To use Gmail with this project, you need your email address and an "App Password" (not your regular password) if you have 2-Step Verification enabled.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Enable IMAP in Gmail:**
  - Go to [Gmail Settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop)
  - Under "Forwarding and POP/IMAP", enable "IMAP access" and save changes.

2. **Generate an App Password:**
  - Go to your [Google Account Security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
  - Under "Signing in to Google", select "App passwords" (you may need to enable 2-Step Verification first).
  - Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" (or "Custom name") for the device, e.g., "Internship Automation".
  - Click "Generate" and copy the 16-character app password.

3. **Use These Credentials:**
  - When running `setup.py`, enter your Gmail address as the IMAP user and the app password as the IMAP password.
  - IMAP server: `imap.gmail.com`

**Note:**
- Your regular Gmail password will not work if 2-Step Verification is enabled; you must use an app password.
- Keep your app password secure and do not share it.
